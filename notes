Order topology construction:

Each order knows what other territories' resolutions depend on it. Therefore, construct a directed graph that is the inverse of the graph we want:

A sup B to C
C mov D
D hold

becomes
A -> B, A -> C
C -> D

Then, invert the graph/traverse the graph backwards:

B -> A, C -> A
D -> C
